Once you login, you will see the Admin Dashboard. Everything can be done from this page, so if in doubt, just come back to this page (festigo.travel/wp-admin)

Account details
==================
From the Admin dashboard, go to the top right corner where it says "G'day" and hover over it, then click on "Edit Profile"

The main thing here is to change your password. The only other thing to change is the "Display name publicly as..." option. This is what people we see as the "author" when you write an article. Besides that, there's not much to do on this page. All the other info is not really important


Festivals
==================
To add a festival, Click on "My Festivals". You will see a list of festivals that are already on your site. Then click on "Add new" to add a new one.

You should see a page that looks like a form.

(If the left side menu disappeared on your screen after clicking "add new", go to the three little dots on the top right and click on  "view --> Full screen mode" to disable fullscreen mode)

There's a blue publish button near the top right that you can use to save your Festival. In general, you can save stuff and make as edits to them as much as you like later. But sometimes you won't be able to save if one of the form fields is empty but required.

Before you do anything Look at the settings on the right side. There are only 3 things you need to care about here:
1. Permalink - this is the URL that people can use to go straight to the Festival info page. If you set a Title (see below) a sensible permalink will be generated for you based on the title, but you can always customize it to your liking.
2. Genres: You can add genres to festivals so people can search for it by genre.
3. Featured image: This is the image that will be shown On Cards (on the festival search page) and it will become the big banner that you see on the festival info page.
4. (ignore the music groups setting on the right bar, use the music group field in the main form instead)

Now looking at the main middle section from top to bottom:

There's a space that says "Add title". Add the title of the festival here. For example "Defqon 2021". I recommend you add the year at the end, but you don't have to. This is the exact title that people will see throughout the website when they are browsing festivals.

Just below that is a small section that says "Type / to choose a block". This is the "content" area. This is where you can write paragraphs, add bullet points, images, and format it like a word document. Whatever you write here will be shown on the festival page. This is where you would write things like a description of the festival, exact dates and times, and any extra info you want to show to users.

(note, when you start writing stuff inside the content area, that small settings column on the right might change and you might be wondering where the other settings disappeared to, like the permalink and the genres and the featured image. This is because this right side bar is also used to change settings inside the content area. But if you want to see the original settings for the festival, there should be two tabs on this column: "Festival" and "block". Just click on the Festival tab to get back the original settings)

Below that is a section called "Festival Fields" and it looks like a form. All of the form fields should be self-explanatory, but here are some important notes:

- "Google Maps Link" - to get a google maps link, just visit google maps, search for the location and copy the URL from your browser
- "Tickets released" - this is set to "released" by default. If you want to add a festival BEFORE tickets are released, you should click on this toggle to set it to "unreleased". When you do this, the festival button will change from "Book now" to "get updates". If you do this, remember to edit
- "Packages" - To select packages, you have to actually create the products first (see below), and if you click on this field, you should be able to search for the packages that are on your site. You can select multiple packages.
- "Featured Artists" - Same as packages. You need to create artists first, and then they will appear here. You can select multiple artists.
- "Music Group" - When you click on on this field, you will see a list of Music Groups, or you can create new ones by typing. You can only select one music group.
- "Featured" - If this is set to "Yes", it will appear on the home page in that carousel


Club Events
==============
To add a Club Event, Click on "My Club Events". You will see a list of club events that are already on your site. Then click on "Add new" to add a new one.

You should see a page that looks like a form.

It looks almost exactly like the "Add festival" page, except for a few form fields.

In general, you will find the most things look like this. There's the title, the content area and some form fields and (maybe) some settings on the right.

For Club events, the important things to fill in are:
- permalink (optional)
- Genres (right hand side)
- Featured image (right hand side)
- Title (top middle)
- Content (the part where it says "Type / to choose a block")
- The form


Articles
==============
To add a Article, Click on "My Articles". You will see a list of articles that are already on your site. Then click on "Add new" to add a new one.

For articles, the important things to fill in are:
- Title (top middle)
- Content (the part where it says "Type / to choose a block")
- Featured image
- Excerpt (This is the 1-2 sentence summary that people will see as a preview before they click to see the whole article)


Artists
==============
Same as as the rest. click on "My Artists" in the left in the Admin dashboard, then click "add new"

The important things to fill in for artists are:
- Title (this will be the name of the artist)
- Content (this is the description and "about" info that will be displayed on the artist page)
- Social media links (in the form)
- Genres (right side)
- Featured image (right side)


Competition page (or any other page)
=============
To create a generic static page, go to "pages" > "add new"

This looks like any of the other "add x" pages, except there's no form. There's only the title and the content. You can also add a featured image if you want. This will be shown at the top of the page as a big banner.

This is how you can add pages like a Competition page.


Testimonials
================
Testimonials are bit further down on the left hand side. This works the same as everything else, except you won't see a "content" section. Just add a Name, Testimonial and featured image (on the right side) and you will see the testimonial on the home page.


Products, Packages, Accommodation, etc
================
A product is anything that you want to sell on your website, like packages, etc. This is a little bit harder becuase there's a bunch of options you don't need.

Before you add a product remember that:
- To add a package, you need to create each product separately. For example, you create an "accommodation" product, create a "tickets" product and then creaet a "package" product that combines them together (see below)
- All products are created by going to "products" > "Add new". There's no separate workflow for packages, accommodation, tickets, etc

The FIRST thing to do when you add a new product is add a product name and then go to the right hand side and under "product categories" select the product category (e.g. accommodation, addon, package, etc). Note that roducts can only belong to one category. Every product MUST have a category.

Then click PUBLISH.

This is important because some options will only show once the category has been set and the product has been saved. Don't worry you can publish products but nobody will see them until you add the product to a package and add the package to a festival.

There's only a few things you need to edit:
1. The form data (if there is any). Remember it won't show until you give the product a name and a category.
2. Product image (on the right side) - but only for accommodation products. All other products don't need an image
3. Product tags: you don't need this EXCEPT for addons where you don't want them to have a price. If you don't want an addon to have a price, add "price_tba" as a tag inside the product tags.
4. On the middle of the screen, after the content or after the form data, there is a box labelled "Product data". There are a few tabs inside that box, but you only need to worry about 2 of them:

Product data box:
- General: here you can set the price. Do NOT set the price of the product unless it is a "package" product or an "addon" product
- Inventory: By default, a product will be infinitely in stock unless you check the box that says "manage stock"? and then add a stock quantity. Everytime a product is sold, this quantity will go down automatically. But for some items you might just want to keep it at infinite stock, like the "flights" addon or the "flight insurance" addon.



Flights and Flight insurance:
=============================
In general, you need to create a separate product for each festival. For example, you can't just create one product for "tickets" because EDC tickets cost different to Deqfon tickets and they have different stock levels. But for Flight and Flight Insurance, since we deal with these manually, it's OK to just have one "flights" product and one "flight insurance" product.


Images
===========================
How images work is that you only need to upload an image once, but it can be used in many different places. Becareful not to upload
